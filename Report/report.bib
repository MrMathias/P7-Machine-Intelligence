  TITLE =         {PAutomaC: a PFA/HMM Learning Competition},
  ABSTRACT =      {Approximating distributions over strings is a hard learning problem. Typical techniques
involve using nite state machines as models and attempting to learn these; these machines
can either be hand built and then have their weights estimated, or built by grammatical
inference techniques: the structure and the weights are then learnt simultaneously. The
PAutomaC competition is the rst challenge that will allow to compare methods and
build a rst state of the art for these latter techniques. Both articial data and real data
will be proposed and contestants are to try to estimate the probabilities of unseen strings.. },
