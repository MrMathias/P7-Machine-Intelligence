\section{Datasets}
Pautomac delivered 48 datasets, which given this project's time constraint is too many, so a dataset selection method has to be devised. We want to understand how the presented algorithms handle the different known variations, of the model that originally created the datasets. There are three variables; the amount of states, a density percentage and the observable symbol alphabet size.

There is not obvious pattern in which Pautomac produced these datasets, which can easily be seen when plotting the datasets in a coordinate system:

We know the range of all the variables, which should be covered to some extend by the given datasets. For instance, states range from 6 to 73, if we want to find a reasonable cover for the state variable, we want something close to 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 and 70, where the overall deviation from
