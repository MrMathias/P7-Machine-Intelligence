\subsubsection{Sparse Baum Welch}
This algorithm takes an input $(n, t, s, D)$ and creates a \gls{hmm} $M$ with $n$ states and $s$ symbols.
All parameters are initialized randomly but with the constraint that each state has exactly $\lceil log(n) \rceil$ outgoing transitions.
Which transitions to discard are chosen randomly.
Return $BW(M_t, D)$.
