\subsection{Greedy Extend}
This algorithm starts with a graph $G$ of 1 node. The node has initial probability 1, loops to itself with probability 1, and its emission probabilities are chosen randomly and normalized.

Through a number of iterations $i = 1 ... k$, do the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item $G'$ = $(V(G) \cup \{y'\}, E(G))$, where $y'$ is a new node with a random initial probability in range $[0, 1]$ and random emission probabilities summing to $1$.
\item Choose a number of random nodes $Y = \{y_1, y_2, ... , y_l\} \in V(G')$, where $l = \lceil log(|V(G')|) \rceil$ and $\forall a,b: y_a \neq y_b$.
\item For each $y \in Y$, the transitions $(y, y')$ and $(y', y)$ are added to $E(G')$ with random transition probabilities.
\item Normalize $G'$ and run Baum Welch on $G'$.
\item If $LL(G') > LL(G)$, where $LL(G)$ is the log likelihood of $G$, then set $G = G'$.
\end{itemize}

Return $G$.
